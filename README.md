# SEO-Refactor-HTML-Horiseon
This is the first homework assignment for the OSU coding boot camp. We are refactoring functional code to use higher coding standards.

Previously the html on the page was using many div tags while there were more semantic tags that would be applicable; along with the images not having the alt attribute added on them for accessability for everyone. 

## In this refactor

    1.The div tags have been changed to the appropriate tags.
    2.The CSS has been updated to work alongside the new tags.
    3.Whitespace has been added for cleaner readability.
    4.CSS has been re-organized in order to follow the flow of the webpage.
    5.CSS comments have been added for each of the sections.
    6.Title has been changed from website to "Horiseon".
